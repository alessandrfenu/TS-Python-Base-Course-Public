    "\n",
    "This exercise aims to teach the principles of Polymorphism, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Encapsulation through an accounting use case. Students will create a Python program to represent different types of accounts and operations while adhering to OOP principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem Description**\n",
    "You are tasked with designing a system to manage bank accounts. There are several types of accounts, such as SavingsAccount and CheckingAccount, which share some common operations (like deposit and withdraw) but also have unique behaviors. You will implement this system using Object-Oriented Programming principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Step 1:** Define the Base Class (Abstraction)\n",
    "Create an abstract class BankAccount with:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Protected attributes _balance and _account_holder.\n",
    "- An abstract method withdraw to enforce implementation in subclasses.\n",
    "- A concrete method deposit to allow adding money to the account.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Create Subclasses (Inheritance)**\n",
    "Define two subclasses:\n",
    "\n",
    "- SavingsAccount: Implements withdraw with the restriction that you cannot withdraw more than the balance.\n",
    "- CheckingAccount: Implements withdraw but allows overdrafts up to $500.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: Implement Data Protection (Encapsulation)**\n",
    "Ensure that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The _balance attribute is protected.\n",
    "- Provide a method get_balance to view the current balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4: Demonstrate Polymorphism**\n",
    "Write a function process_account(account, amount) that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Accepts any account type (Savings or Checking).\n",
    "- Calls the withdraw method to handle withdrawals, demonstrating polymorphism.\n"
